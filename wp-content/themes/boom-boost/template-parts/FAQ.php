            just check discription, or ask in live chat. Sometime we need an access to your account. You have to
            give us login, password and code of Battle.net authenticator (in case it is attached). We never ask for
            secret answers or something that can give full access to your account; We will need only code from
            e-mail. Do not log on after you change the password. If you do, we could not log on with new password.
            You will have to repeat this procedure again. If you need to do it for some reason, inform us about
            that. If you have the authenticator, you have to pass us the code before the service is to begin. Make
            sure you have deactivated the requirement to enter the code each time you log in game.</div>
